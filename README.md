# Web Development Labs & Projects

This repository contains a collection of web development labs and projects completed as part of my coursework.

The labs focus on building a strong foundation in front-end and basic server-side web development, with an emphasis on writing clean, functional code and understanding how different web technologies work together.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 – page structure and semantic markup  
- CSS3 – layouts, styling, and responsive design  
- JavaScript – client-side interactivity and DOM manipulation  
- Perl (CGI) – basic server-side scripting  
- Additional tools and libraries as required by specific labs

## Project Structure
Each lab is provided as a PDF submission (as required by the course) and includes:
- Source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl)
- Screenshots of program output
- Explanations of functionality and logic

## Topics Covered
- HTML forms and input handling  
- CSS layouts (Flexbox, positioning, styling)  
- JavaScript events and DOM manipulation  
- Client–server interaction using Perl CGI scripts  
- Input validation and dynamic content generation  

## Notes
These labs were submitted in PDF format to demonstrate both code and output together in a single document.  
They represent progressive learning exercises rather than production-level applications.
